# Homologous_pairing
Fortran codes for simulating the dynamics of 2 pairs of homologous chromosomes using kinetic Monte-Carlo for lattice polymers. 

Developed by Daniel Jost

# Description
In Drosophila, homologous chromosomes become gradually paired along embryogenesis. To investigate this process, we developed a button-based polymer model. Some homologous loci have the capacity to interact at short-range. We simulate two pairs of homologs.The dynamics of each polymeric chains is driven by these interactions and by excluded volume. To simulate this dynamics, we used the kinetic Monte-Carlo algorithm applied to lattice polymers *3DEpiBlock.Energy* (see corresponding references for details on the methods).
